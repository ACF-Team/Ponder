## Getting Started

If you're new to Ponder, we recommend following these steps:

1. Read the [Ponder Wiki](Ponder_Wiki.md) to understand the core concepts
2. Review the [Example Storyboard](Ponder_Example.lua) to see how everything fits together
3. Use the [Quick Reference Guide](Ponder_QuickReference.md) as a handy reference while coding
4. Start creating your own storyboard using the [Storyboard Template](Ponder_Template.lua)

## Key Concepts

Ponder is built around several key concepts:

- **Storyboard**: The main container for a tutorial
- **Chapter**: A section of a storyboard containing a sequence of instructions
- **Instruction**: An individual action like placing a model, showing text, or moving the camera
- **Environment**: The 3D space where the tutorial takes place
- **Playback**: Controls the playback of a storyboard

## Creating Your First Storyboard

To create a basic storyboard:

1. Copy the [Storyboard Template](Ponder_Template.lua) to a new file in your addon's `lua/ponder/storyboards_cl/` directory
2. Customize the storyboard properties (name, description, icon)
3. Add your own instructions to each chapter
4. Test your storyboard in-game

## Tips for Effective Tutorials

1. **Plan your storyboard** before coding
2. **Keep chapters focused** on one concept or step
3. **Use appropriate timing** to allow users to read and understand
4. **Add descriptive text** to guide the user through each step
5. **Test frequently** to ensure smooth animations and correct timing
